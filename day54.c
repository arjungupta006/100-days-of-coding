//Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
n = 8
Output 1:
6

Input 2:
n = 1
Output 2:
1

Input 3:
n = 4
Output 3:
-1
